# Rust for Hackers - Collection

Welcome to the **Rust for Hackers** repository! This repository contains a collection of applications developed as part of the Rust for Hackers series on my YouTube channel, [aalphaas](https://www.youtube.com/@Aalphaas). Here, you'll find various projects that demonstrate the power and versatility of the Rust programming language in the context of hacking and security.

## Introduction

In this series, we explore different aspects of Rust programming, focusing on building practical applications that can be useful for hackers, security researchers, and developers. Each project is designed to be educational and to showcase Rust's features, such as memory safety, concurrency, and performance.
